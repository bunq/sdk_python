### How to contribute to the bunq Python SDK 😎

#### Want to add a new amazing feature to our SDK? 🚀
- First let’s discuss the feature that you would like to add. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/bunq/sdk_python/issues/new), describe the feature and explain why you think it should be added.
- Once we agree on the new feature, open a new GitHub pull request and include all the relevant information to get your code approved!

#### Did you find a bug? 🐛
- Before opening a new issue check if the bug hasn't already been reported by searching on GitHub under [issues](https://github.com/bunq/sdk_python/issues).  
- If it hasn't already been reported you can [open a new issue](https://github.com/bunq/sdk_python/issues/new). Make sure you include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behaviour that is not occurring.
- If you wrote a patch that fixes a bug, open a new GitHub pull request and make sure to clearly describe the problem and your awesome solution. 

#### Do you have questions about the source code?
- You are welcome to ask whatever you want about the bunq Python SDK on [Together](https://together.bunq.com) 🎤

#### Are you looking for a challenging new adventure?
